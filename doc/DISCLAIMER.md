# Disclaimer

All hashing is done directly in the browser. Your data is not sent to any server, ever. If you are skeptical, which I respect, I recommend [downloading the latest release here](https://github.com/pRizz/Simple-Hash-Generator/releases), turning off your internet, unzip the release, open index.html, check out the network debugger, and see that hashing still works. Or if you are a developer, you can audit the [source code here](https://github.com/pRizz/Simple-Hash-Generator).
